### What exactly does it do? 
  - developing a mobile application to access the information on NASAâ€™s Prediction of Worldwide    renewable Energy Resources (POWER) web services portal and provide  useful information about sunshine to the general public.

### How does it work?
dispaly google map to user to choose location and then ,choose the can change  parameters   (e.g., the temporal resolution, time  period), then results  displayed via clearly labeled graphs.

### What benefits does it have? 
makes it easy  to get useful data associated with sunshine to the general public in an accessible manner

### What do you hope to achieve?
we hope world use the renewable energy , and leave the air-pollution resources , by providing simple data about sun-shine

### What tools, coding languages, hardware, or software did you use to develop your project?
Coding language : type-script
Hardware: linux desktop , android phone
Software: vscode 
Version control: git, github
Framework : react native (cross platform front-end framework)
Cloud services: expo(building) , googleMaps(map_provider)
Libraries: (react-native-maps, vectory)

### Details about what space agency data used
we used the **power API** (provided by space agency) , after the  user input the data ,
we change the api paramters and request it to return the data to user 

### how you used it?
-user input the data ,
we change the api paramters and request it to return the data to user 

### how it inspired your project
it was very important data as we call data from it and just display it

## Hackathon Journey
#How would you describe your Space Apps experience? 
it was very interesting ,as we learned the team-work and how to achieve any thing in short time  
# What did you learn?
- team-work and how to achieve any thing in short time  
#What inspired your team to choose this challenge?
helping to save the earth by using renewable energy.

#What was your approach to developing this project?
detecting the input and output
draw logical digram for project process
choosing the appropriate  technology
start by creat github and make every one of team develope specific section
